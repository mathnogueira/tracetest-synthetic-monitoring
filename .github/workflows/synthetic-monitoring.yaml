  # Normally, we run synthetic monitoring in a time schedule. GitHub Actions allows
  # us to achieve that using a cron job. Read more of how cron jobs are configured in
  # this article: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12058_01/doc/doc.1014/e12030/cron_expressions.htm
  #
  # Here are some examples of valid cron strings:
  #
  #- cron: '*/30 * * * *' # every 30 minutes
  #- cron: '*/5 * * * *' # every 5 minutes
  #- cron: '* * * * *' # every minute
  #- cron: '0 */1 * * *' # every hour
  #
  # For this example, we are going to run the job every 5 minutes
  - cron: '*/5 * * * *'
